# Project Description as of 19/03/2025

## Overview:
This is a multithreaded server designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously. It serves HTML files from different ports and directs clients to the appropriate server based on current load. The system tracks active users, removes inactive ones, and includes a monitoring server to track real-time user activity and server load. It implements a delay mechanism for routing to ensure balanced load distribution and features a secure login system with authentication and session management. The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy addition of new features and servers as demand increases. 

### Future Implementations:
- **User Session Timeout Management**: TO IMPLEMENT
- **Admin Dashboard Features**: TO IMPLEMENT

## PUP.db Overview:
PUP.db [Project Usernames Passwords] is a database file used for storing user credentials and permissions. It typically contains tables for usernames, passwords, and user roles, ensuring secure access control within the application. The database is accessed by the server to validate user logins and manage session data, playing a crucial role in maintaining security and user management.

### PUP.db Structure and Functionality:

- **Database Type:**
  - PUP.db is commonly an SQLite database, which is lightweight and serverless, making it ideal for applications that require a simple yet effective way to manage user data.

- **Tables:**
  - **Users Table:**
    - **Columns:** Typically includes fields such as `username`, `password_hash`, `role`, and `last_login`.
    - **Purpose:** Stores user credentials and roles, allowing the application to authenticate users and determine their access levels.

  - **Permissions Table:**
    - **Columns:** May include `role`, `permission_type`, and `resource`.
    - **Purpose:** Defines what actions each user role can perform within the application, ensuring that users have appropriate access to resources.

- **Data Security:**
  - **Password Storage:**
    - Passwords are usually stored as hashes (e.g., using bcrypt or SHA-256) rather than plain text to enhance security.

  - **Access Control:**
    - The application checks user credentials against the data in PUP.db during the login process, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain features.

### Interaction with the Application:

- **User  Authentication:**
  - When a user attempts to log in, the application queries PUP.db to retrieve the hashed password associated with the provided username. It then compares the hash of the entered password with the stored hash to verify the user's identity.

- **Session Management:**
  - Upon successful login, the application may create a session entry that includes the user's ID, role, and session expiration time. This information can be stored in memory or a separate session management table in PUP.db.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - The application uses the roles defined in PUP.db to enforce access control. For example, an admin role may have permissions to manage users, while a regular user role may only have access to view content.

### Maintenance and Updates:

- **Database Maintenance:**
  - Regular backups of PUP.db are essential to prevent data loss. This can be automated through scheduled tasks.

- **Schema Updates:**
  - As the application evolves, the database schema may need to be updated to accommodate new features or changes in user management. This requires careful planning to ensure data integrity.

## Why TCP instead of UDP?
- **TCP Benefits:**
  * Guaranteed delivery of data.
  * Automatic packet ordering.
  * Flow control and congestion control.
  * Connection-oriented communication.
  * Error checking and recovery.
- **UDP would be unsuitable because:**
  * No guarantee of packet delivery.
  * No packet ordering.
  * No connection state tracking.
  * No flow control.
