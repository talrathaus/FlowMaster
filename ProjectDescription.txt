# Project Description as of 17/03/2025

Overview: This is a multithreaded server that handles multiple client requests at once. It serves HTML files from different ports and directs clients to the right server based on current load. It keeps track of active users and removes inactive ones. The system includes a monitoring server to track real-time user activity and server load, implements a delay mechanism for routing to ensure balanced load distribution, and features a secure login system with authentication and session management.

Technical Architecture:
- Uses TCP sockets for reliable client-server communication
- Implements thread-based concurrency for handling multiple simultaneous connections
- Maintains shared state with thread-safe mechanisms
- Provides load balancing through a routing server architecture
- Implements heartbeat mechanism for user activity tracking
- Includes a monitoring server for real-time statistics with authenticated access
- Implements a delay mechanism in the routing server to ensure even distribution
- Features a secure login system with username/password authentication and session management

What it does:
1. Port Check: Ensures all required ports are available before startup.
2. Static Servers: Serves HTML files from different ports.
3. Routing Server: A main server (port ROUTING_PORT) that sends clients to the least busy server with a delay mechanism.
4. Monitoring Server: Provides real-time data about server load and active users behind authentication.
5. User Tracking: Regularly updates the list of active users and removes inactive ones.
6. Authentication: Implements secure login with username/password verification.
7. Session Management: Tracks authenticated sessions using session IDs and cookies.
8. User Management: Allows administrators to disconnect users and deny access.
9. Graceful Shutdown: When stopped, it logs active users before exiting.

Main Components:
1. Socket (socket module):
   - Used for network communication
   - Implements TCP protocol for reliable data transfer
   - Handles client connections and data transmission

2. Threading (threading module):
   - Enables concurrent handling of multiple clients
   - Provides thread-safe mechanisms (Lock) for shared resource access
   - Runs background tasks for user tracking

3. Signal (signal module):
   - Handles system signals for graceful shutdown
   - Ensures proper cleanup on program termination

4. Time/Datetime:
   - Manages user session timeouts
   - Tracks user activity timestamps
   - Handles periodic maintenance tasks
   - Introduces delay in routing to optimize load distribution

5. Logging:
   - Records server activities and errors
   - Provides debugging information
   - Tracks user connections and server state

6. Authentication:
   - Validates user credentials from SQLite database
   - Manages session tokens
   - Provides access control to monitoring dashboard

7. Session Management:
   - Tracks authenticated sessions
   - Uses cookies for session persistence
   - Implements timeouts for security

8. Database Integration:
   - Uses SQLite for user credential storage
   - Retrieves username, password, and permission data
   - Supports the authentication system

Why TCP instead of UDP?
- TCP Benefits:
  * Guaranteed delivery of data
  * Automatic packet ordering
  * Flow control and congestion control
  * Connection-oriented communication
  * Error checking and recovery
- UDP would be unsuitable because:
  * No guarantee of packet delivery
  * No packet ordering
  * No connection state tracking
  * No flow control

Key Functions Explained:
test_ports():
- Purpose: Validates port availability before server startup
- Process: Attempts to bind to each required port
- Error handling: Logs and returns False if any port is unavailable
- Importance: Prevents startup failures due to port conflicts

parse_user_db():
- Purpose: Loads user credentials from SQLite database
- Process: Connects to database and queries UserPassPerm table
- Output: Returns dictionary with username as key and [password, permission] as value
- Error handling: Handles SQLite errors and returns empty dictionary on failure

signal_handler():
- Purpose: Handles system interrupts (Ctrl+C)
- Process: Initiates graceful shutdown sequence
- Importance: Ensures proper cleanup and resource release

update_active_users():
- Purpose: Maintains accurate user activity tracking
- Process:
  * Runs periodically (HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL)
  * Checks last activity timestamp for each user
  * Removes users inactive beyond TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD
- Thread safety: Uses users_lock for safe state updates

get_server_loads():
- Purpose: Tracks current load on each server
- Process: Counts active users per port
- Thread safety: Uses users_lock for consistent readings

get_monitoring_data():
- Purpose: Provides real-time statistics of server load
- Process: Compiles data from active_users dictionary
- Output: JSON response containing load statistics
- Thread safety: Uses users_lock for accurate readings

select_target_port():
- Purpose: Implements load balancing logic with delay mechanism
- Process:
  * Gets current server loads
  * Identifies servers with minimum load
  * Selects lowest port number among the least loaded servers
  * Ensures delay mechanism is respected for fairness
- Optimization: Favors lower port numbers for consistent distribution

send_redirect():

handle_user_request():
- Purpose: Processes regular user requests
- Process:
  * Parses incoming HTTP requests
  * Identifies clients using ID or IP
  * Handles specialized requests (heartbeat, leave)
  * Routes or serves content based on port
- Thread safety: Uses multiple locks for shared state access
- Security: Identifies and blocks denied users

handle_monitor_request():
- Purpose: Processes monitoring dashboard requests
